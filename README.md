News Articles Dataset Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of news articles to determine their authenticity. The dataset includes various features such as the author, publication date, title, text, language, site URL, main image URL, type, and a binary label indicating whether the article is real or fake.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 2,096 entries and 12 columns. The columns are as follows:

author: The author of the article.
published: The publication date and time of the article.
title: The title of the article.
text: The full text of the article.
language: The language in which the article is written.
site_url: The URL of the publishing site.
main_img_url: The URL of the main image for the article.
type: The type or category of the article.
label: The label indicating whether the article is real (1) or fake (0).
title_without_stopwords: The title of the article with stopwords removed.
text_without_stopwords: The text of the article with stopwords removed.
hasImage: A binary indicator of whether the article includes an image (1) or not (0).
Data Cleaning
To ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis, we performed the following data cleaning steps:

Handling Missing Values:

Filled missing values in the text and text_without_stopwords columns with "No text available".
Filled missing values in the language, site_url, main_img_url, type, label, and title_without_stopwords columns with "Unknown".
Filled missing values in the hasImage column with 0.0.
Verification:

Checked for any remaining null values to ensure all missing data has been handled.
Analysis and Visualization
Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy Stats, the cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis. Potential analyses could include:

Distribution of articles by language.
Frequency of real vs. fake articles.
Common words in titles and texts.
Relationship between article length and authenticity.
Analysis of publication dates and trends over time.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For working with arrays.
Matplotlib: For plots and visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
Scipy Stats: For statistical functions and probability distributions.
How to Use
Load the Dataset: Ensure the dataset (news_articles.csv) is in the working directory and load it using Pandas.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')
Clean the Data: Apply the data cleaning steps to handle missing values.

python
Copy code
cleaned_data = data.copy()
cleaned_data['text'].fillna("No text available", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['text_without_stopwords'].fillna("No text available", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['language'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['site_url'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['main_img_url'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['type'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['label'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['title_without_stopwords'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['hasImage'].fillna(0.0, inplace=True)
Verify the Data: Check for any remaining null values.

python
Copy code
print(cleaned_data.isnull().sum())
Analyze the Data: Use various visualization and statistical techniques to analyze the dataset.

Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into the characteristics of news articles and their authenticity. By cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis, we can explore various patterns and trends that may help in distinguishing real news from fake news.
