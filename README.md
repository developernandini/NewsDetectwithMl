News Articles Dataset Analysis
This project involves analyzing a dataset of news articles to determine their authenticity. The dataset includes various features such as the author, publication date, title, text, language, site URL, main image URL, type, and a binary label indicating whether the article is real or fake.

Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 2,096 entries and 12 columns. The columns are as follows:

##author: The author of the article.
published: The publication date and time of the article.
title: The title of the article.
text: The full text of the article.
language: The language in which the article is written.
site_url: The URL of the publishing site.
main_img_url: The URL of the main image for the article.
type: The type or category of the article.
label: The label indicating whether the article is real (1) or fake (0).
title_without_stopwords: The title of the article with stopwords removed.
text_without_stopwords: The text of the article with stopwords removed.
hasImage: A binary indicator of whether the article includes an image (1) or not (0).
Data Cleaning
To ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis, we performed the following data cleaning steps:

Handling Missing Values:

Filled missing values in the text and text_without_stopwords columns with "No text available".
Filled missing values in the language, site_url, main_img_url, type, label, and title_without_stopwords columns with "Unknown".
Filled missing values in the hasImage column with 0.0.
Verification:

Checked for any remaining null values to ensure all missing data has been handled.
Analysis and Visualization
Using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy Stats, the cleaned dataset is ready for further analysis. Potential analyses could include:

Distribution of articles by language.
Frequency of real vs. fake articles.
Common words in titles and texts.
Relationship between article length and authenticity.
Analysis of publication dates and trends over time.
Libraries Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For working with arrays.
Matplotlib: For plots and visualizations.
Seaborn: For advanced visualizations.
Scipy Stats: For statistical functions and probability distributions.
How to Use
Load the Dataset: Ensure the dataset (news_articles.csv) is in the working directory and load it using Pandas.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('news_articles.csv')
Clean the Data: Apply the data cleaning steps to handle missing values.

python
Copy code
cleaned_data = data.copy()
cleaned_data['text'].fillna("No text available", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['text_without_stopwords'].fillna("No text available", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['language'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['site_url'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['main_img_url'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['type'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['label'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['title_without_stopwords'].fillna("Unknown", inplace=True)
cleaned_data['hasImage'].fillna(0.0, inplace=True)
Verify the Data: Check for any remaining null values.

The training score (BLUE) starts very high when the training data size is small. This is typical as models tend to perform well when the amount of data is limited because they can memorize it rather than generalize from it. As more data is introduced, the training score decreases slightly, suggesting that the model is finding it harder to fit to a larger dataset but then stabilizes. This high initial score combined with the stabilization suggests that the model has a good fit to the training data.
The cross-validation score (GREEN) starts low when the training data size is small, indicating the model doesn't generalize well to unseen data at this point. However, as more data is added, the cross-validation score increases, suggesting that the model's ability to generalize is improving with more data. The upward trend of this line shows that additional data is beneficial to the model's performance on unseen data.
The two lines appear to be converging, but they haven't fully converged within the range of data sizes shown on the graph. The shaded areas around each line represent the variance of the scores, with a smaller shaded area indicating lower variance. The cross-validation score line's shaded area is decreasing as more data is added, which is good as it indicates more stability in the model's generalization ability.
Since the two lines are not converging closely, it might indicate that the model could still improve with more data, or with model tuning. There's no clear sign of severe overfitting (where the training score is significantly higher than the validation score) nor severe underfitting (where both scores are low), but there might be a slight tendency towards overfitting since the training score is consistently higher than the validation score.
Conclusion
This project aims to provide insights into the characteristics of news articles and their authenticity. By cleaning the data and preparing it for analysis, we can explore various patterns and trends that may help in distinguishing real news from fake news.
